You are free to use, modify, and distribute this project, but please give attribution to the authors. By open-sourcing WIN, we hope to encourage collaboration and further innovation at the nexus of AI and smart accounts. (`WIN` is a hackathon project; [use at your own risk – not audited for production](safe.mirror.xyz).

*“Smart Accounts are critical infrastructure for the agent economy... Safe’s account programmability and customisable logic will allow the infinite offchain activity of AI agents to be* [*fully leveraged in the onchain economy.”*](safe.global)

*SAFE’s wallet infrastructure is a core component of AI agent sovereignty, showcasing “the potential smart accounts have to accelerate innovation for on-chain* [*AI agents.”*](safe.mirror.xyz)

*SAFE’s multisig feature allows co-owned accounts by multiple agents, enabling fault tolerance and decentralization among* [*AI operators*](safe.mirror.xyz).

*Transaction Guards can enforce checks before/after a Safe transaction – ensuring even if an agent runs malicious code, it’s restricted to* [*allowed actions*](docs.safe.global).

*Safe Modules (e.g., spending allowances) let you set limits on amounts that can be spent without additional approvals – useful for controlling autonomous* [*agents’ expenditures*](docs.safe.global).


*SAFE AI documentation provides guides for multiple agent setups, human approval flows, and advanced configurations for AI-controlled* [*SAFEs*](safe.global).

*Safe{Core} is an open-source smart account stack securing $100B+ in assets – a testament* [*to its security and trustworthiness*](safe.global).

*The SAFE Agentathon (Feb 3-17, 2025) offered $200k in bounties to developers “pushing the boundaries of AI innovation,” setting the stage for projects like WIN*.
